# Jbofi'ipli - Lojban IDE

Not even close to functional Lojban IDE.

The idea is to help authoring Lojban text with programming-like tools:
colouring by morphology (eg. cmavo, gismu, etc.), integrated definitions, word
search, and parsing.

## Interfaces

The intention is to make this available in several ways:

- As a command-line tool
- As an editor on the web
- As a Language Server for integration with other tools.

(Probably in that order.)
